Ran SetTester.java to see the failed tests. First failed test is emptySet_testIsEmpty. Put breakpoint on line 658 of SetTester.java, the rear value was correct but the returned boolean was incorrect. Looked within isEmpty() and fixed the issue by changing (rear > 0) to (rear == 0).
The next failed test is emptySet_addA_A_testIsEmpty. Put breakpoint on line 137 of SetTester.java, the set was correct with the added element but the rear value was incorrect. Looked within add() and saw that when adding a new element to the set, the value of rear does not increase. Added rear++ after setArray[rear] = element.
The next failed test is testRemove. Put breakpoint on line 604 of SetTester.java, the set was not correct after running the remove() method. Looked within remove() for the issue. The logic for the removal does not make sense. When you shift all the elements forward, the element that needs to be removed does not get removed. Changed the nested while loop to shift all the elements backward, overwriting the removed element.
After these changes and running SetTester.java, all tests passed.
